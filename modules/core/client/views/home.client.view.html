    <h2>Why you need non-life insurance?</h2>
    <p>
      When one has earned and accumulated property, protecting it is prudent.One of the main reasons one should insure assets is to protect themselves against the financial losses likely to occur due to their destruction/ inability to perform. Anyone who owns a valuable asset can buy insurance to protect it against losses due to fire, theft, and so on.</p>

    <p>The law also requires us to be insured against some liabilities. This is to ensure that we can afford to pay compensation in case a liability arises. Once you have insurance, the responsibility of paying the compensation is transferred to an insurance company.</p>

    <p>That is, in case we should cause a loss to another person, that person is entitled to compensation (for e.g. the third party auto insurance, which is a compulsory part of the motor insurance we buy).
